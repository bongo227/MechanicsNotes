# Power
Power is the rate of which a force does work on a body. 
$$
\text{Power} = \frac{\text{Work done}}{\text{time}}
$$
Using $$w=Fd$$ the formula for power becomes
$$
\begin{align}
P &= \frac{Fd}{s}\\
P &= Fv
\end{align}
$$

#### Example
Given the body has a mass of $$660\text{ kg}$$ and the power of the system is $$16\text{ kW}$$ what is the vehicles maximum speed.

###### Find $$F$$
$$
\begin{align}
F &= ma\\
F - 660g\sin(17^{\circ}) - 140 &= 660 \times 0\\
F &= 2031\text{ N}\\
\end{align}
$$

###### Find $$v$$
$$
\begin{align}
16000 &= 2031 \times v\\
v &= 7.878\\
&= 7.88\text{ ms}^{-1}
\end{align}
$$
