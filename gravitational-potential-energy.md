# Gravitational potential energy
Gravitational potential energy is the energy stored in an object due to its height above a gravitational field. Its calculated with $$G.P.E. = mgh$$.

#### Example
The mass is released from the top of the following system, if it looses $$1\text{ MJ}$$ what is its mass.

###### Find $$h$$
$$
\begin{align}
sin(13^{\circ}) &= \frac{h}{240}\\
240 \times sin(13^{\circ}) &= h\\
h &= 53.988\\
&= 54.0\text{ m}\\
\end{align}
$$

###### Find $$m$$
$$
\begin{align}
G.P.E. &= mgh\\
1000000 &= m \times 9.8 \times 54.0\\
\frac{1000000}{9.8 \times 54.0} &= m\\
m &= 1889.645\\
&= 1890\text{ kg}\\
\end{align}
