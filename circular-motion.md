# Circular motion
Their is two ways of measuring the speed of a body on a circular path, the strait line speed in the direction of the tangent, or the rate of change of the radius called angular speed given by:
$$
\omega = \frac{\theta}{t}
$$
where $$\omega$$ is measured in radians per second.

Given an arc of radius $$r$$ and angle $$\theta$$ the arc length is $$r\theta$$ hence $$v = \frac{r\theta}{t}$$. Given $$\omega = \frac{\theta}{t}$$ we can derive the conversion formular:
$$
v = r \omega
$$
Similarly the acceleration is given by:
$$
\begin{align}
a &= r \omega^2\\
a &= \frac{v^2}{r}
\end{align}
$$

#### Example
A body of mass $$800 \text{ kg}$$ travels along a rough circular path of $$40 \text{ m}$$ with an angular speed of $$0.2 \text{ rad s}^{-1}$$. Find the least value of the coefficient of friction.

$$
\begin{align}
v &= r \omega \\
&= 40 \times 0.2\\
&= 8
\end{align}
$$$$
\begin{align}
a &= r\omega^2\\
&= 40 \times 0.2^2\\
&= 1.6
\end{align}
$$$$
\begin{align}
F &= ma\\
&= 800 \times 1.6\\
&= 1280
\end{align}
$$$$
\begin{align}
F \leq \mu R\\
1280 \leq \mu \times 800 \times 9.8\\
\mu \geq 0.163
\end{align}
$$
