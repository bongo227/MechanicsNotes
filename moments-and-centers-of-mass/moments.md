# Moments

A moment is a turning force about a point expressed by a $$m = Fd$$ where $$m$$ is the moment $$F$$ is the magnitude of the force and $$d$$ is the distance from the pivot.

If more that one force is acting on the pivot we must add all the moments to find the total moment about that point. If the sum of the moments equals zero then the pivot will be at **equalibribum** (it won't rotate).
