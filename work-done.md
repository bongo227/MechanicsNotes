# Work done
The work done by a force is when the force moves an object through a distance. $$w = Fs$$ where $$w$$ is work done, $$F$$ is the force acting on the object and $$s$$ is the distance the object was displaced.

#### Example
Given the following system moves 3.5m, and the work done on the object is 28J, find the force of friction.

$$
\begin{align}
w &= Fs\\
28 &= (60\cos(40) - F) \times 3.5\\
8 &= 60\cos(40) - F\\
8 - 60\cos(40) &= -F\\
F &= -37.963\\
&= 38.0
\end{align}
